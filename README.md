# ðŸ¥Ÿ st-paywall

<strong>A python package for creating paid Streamlit apps with a paywall! </strong>

## Why st-paywall?

I made st-paywall so data scientists and LLM developers can create small businesses around their Streamlit apps. Every week I see dozens of new incredible apps built in Streamlit that are adored by users, but eventually shut down or moved off of Streamlit as authentication and payment integration are too hard. This is my attempt at a dead-simple API around each, abstracting the both away into a single function (`add_auth`). Enjoy!

## Documentation

Once you configure the authentication and subscription on `st.secrets`, you can use the the library methods to conditionally render the content of the page:

```python
from st_paywall import add_auth

add_auth()

#after authentication, the email and subscription status is stored
#in session state
st.write(st.session_state.email)
st.write(st.session_state.user_subscribed)
```


The full documentation for the usage of the library can be found at https://st-paywall.readthedocs.io/.
