<strong>A template for how to create subscription Streamlit apps </strong>


## Overview

This repo shows you how to add both Google authentication and a Stripe subscription to your Streamlit apps. I hope you use this to create tons of value, and capture some of it with the magic of Streamlit!

- google_auth.py: this holds all of the Google Oauth parts of this code
- stripe_auth.py: this holds all the Stripe button creation and customer listing
- streamlit_app.py: this brings it all together, and has the code after users have subscribed
